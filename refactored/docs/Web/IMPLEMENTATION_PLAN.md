</div>

## üìã Overview

The implementation will be broken down into several phases to ensure a smooth migration from the terminal-based application to a web interface. Each phase focuses on specific components and builds upon the previous work.

## üîÑ Phase 1: Database Migration

**Duration: 1-2 weeks**

The first phase involves migrating from the current JSON file storage to SQLite using SQLAlchemy.

### Tasks

1. Set up SQLAlchemy models
   - Create models for User, Wallet, Transaction, Block, and Contact
   - Define relationships between models

2. Create database migration scripts
   - Build scripts to convert JSON data to SQLite
   - Implement data validation and cleaning

3. Develop and test DatabaseDataHandler
   - Implement the adapter pattern to maintain compatibility with existing code
   - Ensure all business logic works with the new data storage

4. Write comprehensive tests
   - Unit tests for models and data access
   - Migration test cases

### Deliverables

- SQLite database schema
- SQLAlchemy models
- Migration utility
- Updated data handler implementation
- Test coverage for database layer

## üîå Phase 2: API Development

**Duration: 2-3 weeks**

This phase involves creating the FastAPI backend that will expose the blockchain functionality.

### Tasks

1. Set up FastAPI project structure
   - Configure project with proper organization
   - Set up dependency injection system

2. Implement authentication system
   - Develop user registration and login
   - Set up JWT token handling

3. Create API endpoints
   - Wallet management endpoints
   - Transaction endpoints
   - Blockchain operation endpoints
   - Contact management endpoints

4. Integrate with business logic
   - Connect API handlers to existing business logic
   - Develop service layer for each domain

5. Add API documentation
   - Configure Swagger UI and ReDoc
   - Add detailed endpoint descriptions

6. Implement error handling
   - Create consistent error response format
   - Add appropriate HTTP status codes

### Deliverables

- Functioning FastAPI backend
- Complete set of RESTful endpoints
- Authentication system
- API documentation
- Unit and integration tests

## üé® Phase 3: Frontend Development

**Duration: 3-4 weeks**

This phase focuses on building the web interface using Flask for serving pages and modern JavaScript for interactivity.

### Tasks

1. Set up frontend structure
   - Configure Flask routes
   - Organize templates and static assets

2. Design and implement base templates
   - Create layout templates
   - Design component library

3. Develop page templates
   - Create all necessary page templates
   - Implement responsive designs

4. Implement JavaScript functionality
   - Build API service layer
   - Create interactive components
   - Add Alpine.js for reactivity

5. Develop user authentication flow
   - Login and registration pages
   - JWT token handling

6. Implement dashboard and wallet management
   - Wallet display and management
   - Dashboard with summary information

7. Build transaction functionality
   - Transaction creation form
   - Transaction history display

8. Create blockchain explorer
   - Block listing and details
   - Transaction details within blocks

9. Implement contact management
   - Contact list and details
   - Add/edit/delete contacts

### Deliverables

- Complete frontend implementation
- Responsive UI for all features
- JavaScript components and services
- User authentication flow
- Full integration with API

## üß™ Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

**Duration: 2 weeks**

This phase focuses on comprehensive testing and refinement of the entire application.

### Tasks

1. Conduct end-to-end testing
   - Test all user flows
   - Verify API and frontend integration

2. Perform security testing
   - Check for common vulnerabilities
   - Validate authentication system

3. Optimize performance
   - Improve database queries
   - Enhance frontend loading speed

4. Conduct usability testing
   - Gather feedback on UI/UX
   - Make refinements based on feedback

5. Fix bugs and issues
   - Address any identified issues
   - Validate fixes with tests

### Deliverables

- Tested and refined application
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Security validations

## üöÄ Phase 5: Deployment and Documentation

**Duration: 1 week**

The final phase involves preparing the application for deployment and creating comprehensive documentation.

### Tasks

1. Prepare deployment configuration
   - Set up production environment
   - Configure web server

2. Create deployment scripts
   - Automate deployment process
   - Set up database migrations

3. Finalize documentation
   - Update all documentation
   - Create user guides and tutorials

4. Conduct final review
   - Perform final testing
   - Address any remaining issues

### Deliverables

- Deployment configuration
- Comprehensive documentation
- Final tested application ready for production

## üìÖ Timeline Overview

| Phase | Description | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Database Migration | 1-2 weeks | None |
| 2 | API Development | 2-3 weeks | Phase 1 |
| 3 | Frontend Development | 3-4 weeks | Phase 2 |
| 4 | Testing and Refinement | 2 weeks | Phase 3 |
| 5 | Deployment and Documentation | 1 week | Phase 4 |

**Total Estimated Time: 9-12 weeks**

## üîÑ Implementation Approach

### Iterative Development

The implementation will follow an iterative approach with regular milestones:

1. **Weekly Sprints** - Plan and execute work in weekly sprints
2. **Feature Prioritization** - Implement core features first, then add enhancements
3. **Continuous Testing** - Test throughout development rather than only at the end
4. **Regular Reviews** - Conduct code reviews and design reviews regularly

### Risk Management

Potential risks and mitigation strategies:

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Business logic compatibility issues | Early testing of adapter pattern implementation |
| Database migration data loss | Thorough backup and validation processes |
| Security vulnerabilities | Security-focused code reviews and testing |
| Performance bottlenecks | Regular performance testing throughout development |
| Frontend/backend integration challenges | Clear API contract definition upfront |

## üîç Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All existing functionality from the terminal app is available in the web interface
2. Data can be successfully migrated from JSON files to SQLite
3. The application performs efficiently with response times under 500ms for most operations
4. The UI is intuitive and responsive on various devices
5. All automated tests pass
6. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
